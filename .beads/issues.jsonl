Adding to AgentProvider enum in config.py\n\nThis is too much friction for users who just want to add support for another CLI tool.\n\n## Proposed Solution\nSingle providers config file at `~/.config/focusgroup/providers.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[gemini]\ncommand = \"gemini\"\nprompt_flag = \"-p\"\nmodel_flag = \"--model\"\ntimeout = 120\n\n[ollama]\ncommand = \"ollama run\"\nprompt_flag = \"\"              # prompt is positional\nmodel_flag = \"\"               # model is part of command\ndefault_model = \"llama3\"\n\n[local-claude]\ncommand = \"claude\"\nprompt_flag = \"-p\"\nextra_flags = [\"--dangerously-skip-permissions\"]\n```\n\nThen users can use any defined provider:\n```bash\nfocusgroup ask mytool \"question\" --context \"mytool --help\" --provider gemini\nfocusgroup ask mytool \"question\" -x @README.md --provider ollama\n```\n\n## Implementation Notes\n- Keep ClaudeCLIAgent and CodexCLIAgent as built-in defaults\n- Add GenericCLIAgent that handles arbitrary CLI patterns\n- Load ~/.config/focusgroup/providers.toml on startup\n- Registry checks user providers before falling back to built-ins\n- User can override built-ins by defining [claude] or [codex] sections\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Single providers.toml file for all custom CLI providers\n- [ ] Users can define custom CLI providers with command + flags\n- [ ] Custom providers work with all focusgroup commands\n- [ ] Built-in claude/codex continue to work unchanged\n- [ ] User-defined providers can override built-ins\n- [ ] Documentation explains the providers.toml format","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-05T18:02:59.143668828-05:00","created_by":"chris","updated_at":"2026-01-05T20:04:32.020754356-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-05T20:04:32.020754356-05:00","close_reason":"Implemented --plain/--no-rich flag and pluggable CLI providers"}

Add moderator_agent config section:\n   ```toml\n   [session]\n   moderator = true\n\n   [session.moderator_agent]\n   provider = \"codex\"  # or \"claude\", \"openai\"\n   mode = \"cli\"        # or \"api\"\n   model = \"o3\"        # optional\n   ```\n\n2. CLI flag for quick usage:\n   ```bash\n   focusgroup ask mx \"question\" --synthesize-with codex\n   focusgroup ask mx \"question\" --synthesize-with claude-cli\n   ```\n\n3. Support exploration mode for moderator (so it can re-run commands if needed)\n\n## Implementation Notes\n- Update SessionConfig to accept moderator agent config\n- Modify _create_moderator() in orchestrator.py to use user config\n- Add --synthesize-with flag to CLI\n- Ensure CLI agents (Claude CLI, Codex CLI) work as moderators","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-05T16:39:22.154708926-05:00","created_by":"chris","updated_at":"2026-01-05T16:45:26.012795629-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-05T16:45:26.012795629-05:00","close_reason":"Implemented moderator agent selection.
