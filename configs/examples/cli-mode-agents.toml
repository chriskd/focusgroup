# =============================================================================
# CLI Mode Agents - Using actual CLI tools instead of API calls
# =============================================================================
#
# Use this template when you want:
# - Authentic agent behavior (how agents really interact with tools)
# - Testing with the actual claude and codex CLIs
# - More realistic feedback that reflects real-world usage
#
# Requirements:
# - claude CLI installed and authenticated (`claude auth login`)
# - codex CLI installed and authenticated (`codex auth`)
#
# Trade-offs vs API mode:
# - Slower (spawns subprocesses)
# - Less control (uses CLI defaults)
# - More authentic (real agent behavior)
# =============================================================================
