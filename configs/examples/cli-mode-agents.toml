# CLI Mode Agents - Using actual CLI tools for authentic agent behavior
# =============================================================================
#
# Use this template when you want:
# - Authentic agent behavior (how agents really interact with tools)
# - Testing with the actual claude and codex CLIs
# - More realistic feedback that reflects real-world usage
#
# Requirements:
# - claude CLI installed and authenticated (`claude auth login`)
# - codex CLI installed and authenticated (`codex auth`)
#
# Note: All focusgroup agents use CLI mode (no API mode). This gives you
# authentic agent behavior - the same way agents really use tools.
