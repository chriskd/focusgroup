# Mixed Agents Test - Claude + Codex with exploration enabled
# =============================================================================
#
# Use this template when you want:
# - Agents to actually run the tool (exploration mode)
# - Mix of CLI agents for authentic behavior
# - Quick feedback based on real interaction
#
# With exploration = true, agents can:
# - Run the tool with various arguments
# - Explore subcommands
# - Test edge cases
# - Report findings from real usage
#
# Requirements:
# - claude CLI installed and authenticated
# - codex CLI installed and authenticated
# - Tool being evaluated must be in PATH
